# freebitco-in-autoclicker
An autoclicker for freebitco.in website. It saves you for tedious job of clicking every hour and it does this for you.

## Warning!
This script was created to allow freebitco.in users to perform autoclicks on the ROLL botton.
On freebitco.in you have to click the ROLL button once every hour to gather a few free bitcoins.
Using this script, there is no more need for you to check the website every hour.
Although, the usage of this script might be considered as fraud by the website in cause, thus please use it on your own responsibility.

## How it works
This script was created as an extension for the Safari browser. Please search the Safari extensions manuals before installing it.
I will try to provide an installation documentation soon, but in the meanwhile please try do install it on your own.

## Support for additional browsers
This is the first version of the autoclicker, thus it is created only as Safari extension.
Further versions might support additional browsers.
